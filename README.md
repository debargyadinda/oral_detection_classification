# Oral Disease Classification Project

## Description

This repository contains a machine learning model for the classification of oral diseases based on images. The project utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to classify various oral diseases.

## Project Structure

- `preprocessing.py`: Script for image preprocessing and data augmentation.
- `train_model.py`: Script for building and training the CNN model.
- `evaluate.py`: Script for evaluating the model's performance on test data.
- `dataset/`: Directory containing training (`TRAIN`) and testing (`TEST`) datasets.
- `oral_disease_model.keras`: Trained model file.

- Usage

    Preprocessing:

python preprocessing.py

Training:

python train_model.py

Evaluation:

    python evaluate.py

Results

    Confusion Matrix
    Classification Report
    Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
